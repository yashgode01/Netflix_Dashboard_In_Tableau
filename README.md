## Table Of Contents

### Project Overview
Netflix is one of the most popular media and video streaming platforms. They have over 8000 movies or tv shows available on their platform, as of mid-2021, they have over 200M Subscribers globally. This dataset consists of listings of all the movies and tv shows available on Netflix, along with details such as cast, directors, ratings, release year, duration, etc. I begin this process with understanding of the data, connect the data to the Tableau tool and create visualizations. In this paper, I describe in detail the process by which i explored the data and built the visualizations that underlie that work.
